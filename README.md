# Opening the code with Google Colab Environment
Using Google Colab is one of the easiest ways you can use to open the code without installing any extra dependencies.

First, click the .ipynb file inside our repository. After that, you need to download the code. 
After downloading open Google Colab and click the "New Notebook" Tab that is visible on the top right of the page.

Then just browse through your files and add our .ipynb file ðŸ™‚

To rerun the processes, the CSV file link is added in the repo, download that CSV file and when you open the code, click at the file shaped icon at the right menu, and drag the CSV files there.

The code is ready for re-run, you can try and do all the things you want!! ðŸ™‚
